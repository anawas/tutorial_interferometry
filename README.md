# A mini Introduction to Radio Interferometry
Welcome to my collection of Jupyter notebooks and notes on the fascinating field of Radio Interferometry! This repository aims to provide a comprehensive and shorts introduction to radio interferometry observation.

Radio interferometry encompasses diverse concepts and techniques from different fileds, making it both captivating and challenging to grasp. In my experience as a student, I struggled to find a concise, educational explanation that introduced me to the subject from the point of view of a theoretical cosmologist.

Here, I summarized the basic concept from notes and textbooks collected during my studies in a collection of Jupyter notebooks.
