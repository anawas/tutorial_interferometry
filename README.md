# A mini lectures in Radio Interferometry
Welcome to my collection of Jupyter notebooks and notes on the fascinating field of Radio Interferometry! This repository aims to provide a comprehensive introduction to radio interferometry observation from the point of view of a theoretical cosmologist.

The basic requirements to understand and familiarise oneself with radio interferometry encompass diverse concepts and techniques, making it captivating and challenging to grasp. In my experience as a theoretical cosmology student, I encountered this field's complexities. I struggled to find a concise, educational explanation that introduced me to the subject.

Here, I summarized the basic concept from notes and textbooks collected during my studies, which helped me understand radio interferometry's complex field in a collection of Jupyter notebooks.
